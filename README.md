**What?**
 
In this home assignment, we were allocated to a challenge to create an online
application that gives us weather information for a location.It gives the current weather info and also forecast for next five days.
Functionality for saving and displaying search history has been implemented.
 
**Acquired Knowledge**
 
Whilst doing this home assignment, I applied a range of web design
applications & techniques commencing from building the initial Bone
structure in style, and we used the following Technologies:
 
-  <strong>HTML & bootstrap CSS</strong> - During the Introductory phase, we applied
by building a concrete structure with CSS Style formats instead
as we wanted to try something different.
-  <strong>MomentJS</strong> - This intends to change the format of the date information extracted from fetch response.

-  <strong>Fetched APIs</strong> - Used applications openWeather to fetch geocodes  and weather information for a particular location
- <strong>JQuery</strong> - Comparatively, we used JQuery techniques in the
application to ensure the operational dynamics in building
different functions that work from behind the scenes to create a
more engaging user experience.
